# Mixamo: A Powerful Tool for Character Animation
 
Mixamo is a web-based service that allows you to create and animate 3D characters with ease. You can upload your own custom character or choose from a variety of pre-made models, and then apply thousands of motion-captured animations to make them come to life. You can also customize your rigging options with optimizations for mobile performance.
 
One of the best features of Mixamo is the auto-rigger, which automatically rigs your character with a full human skeleton, custom fit to your model and ready to animate. You don't need any prior knowledge of rigging or skinning to use this feature. Just upload your character, adjust some parameters, and download your rigged model in minutes.

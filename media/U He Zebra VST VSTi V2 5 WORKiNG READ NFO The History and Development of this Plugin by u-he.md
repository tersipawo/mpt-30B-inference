Serum is a powerful and versatile synthesizer that allows you to create and manipulate sounds in various ways. You can import your own audio files and use them as wavetables, or you can choose from the hundreds of presets and wavetables that are included in the product. You can also draw your own wavetables using the built-in editor or use the formula parser to generate complex waveforms. Serum has a flexible modulation system that lets you assign any parameter to any modulator, such as envelopes, LFOs, macros, MIDI controllers, and more. You can also use the drag-and-drop feature to easily connect modulators to targets. Serum also has a comprehensive effects section that includes distortion, compression, EQ, filter, delay, reverb, flanger, phaser, chorus, and more. You can reorder and mix the effects as you like and apply them to the whole sound or to individual oscillators.

Serum has a high-quality sound engine that delivers clear and crisp sounds with minimal aliasing and artifacts. Serum also has a low CPU usage and a fast loading time, making it suitable for both studio and live performance situations.

However, Toolbook Neuron is designed for 32 bit Windows operating systems and may not work properly on 64 bit Windows. If you want to use Toolbook Neuron on 64 bit Windows, you may need to follow some steps to make it compatible. Here are some possible solutions:
 
1. Run Toolbook Neuron in compatibility mode. Right-click on the NEURON.EXE file and select Properties. Go to the Compatibility tab and check the box that says "Run this program in compatibility mode for". Choose a 32 bit Windows version from the drop-down menu, such as Windows XP or Windows 7. Click Apply and OK. Then try to run Toolbook Neuron normally.
2. Use a virtual machine. A virtual machine is a software that emulates a different operating system on your computer. You can install a 32 bit Windows version on a virtual machine and then run Toolbook Neuron on it. Some popular virtual machine software are VirtualBox, VMware and Hyper-V. You will need a valid license for the Windows version you want to install on the virtual machine.
3. Use an online emulator. An online emulator is a website that simulates a different operating system or device on your browser. You can access Toolbook Neuron content through an online emulator that supports 32 bit Windows. Some examples of online emulators are BrowserStack, Sauce Labs and CrossBrowserTesting. However, online emulators may have limited functionality and performance compared to running Toolbook Neuron locally.

## What is Toolbook and What Can You Do With It?
 
Toolbook is a powerful authoring tool for e-learning and multimedia content. It was developed by SumTotal Systems, Inc. and was first released in 1990. Toolbook allows you to create interactive content for Windows and/or the web, using a book metaphor. A Toolbook project file is thought of as a book containing pages of content, similar to Microsoft PowerPoint's slides. You can add various objects to your pages, such as text fields, buttons, question objects, rectangles, navigation controls, etc. You can also customize the appearance and behavior of your objects using Toolbook's programming environments: OpenScript and Actions Editor.
 
With Toolbook, you can create various types of content, such as:

- Simulations of neurons and networks of neurons, using Toolbook Neuron.
- Presentations, seminars, lessons and tutorials, using Toolbook's content templates and PowerPoint converter.
- Quizzes, assessments and tests, using Toolbook's question objects and quiz maker.
- Software simulations and demonstrations, using Toolbook's simulation recorder and editor.

Toolbook supports learning standards such as SCORM 1.2, SCORM 2004 and AICC. It also integrates with Learning Management Systems (LMS) to track and report learner progress and performance. Toolbook can deliver appealing and effective learning experiences across major operating systems, web browsers, smartphones and other mobile devices.

If you want to use Xmanager 4, you need a valid product key to activate it. However, buying a product key can be expensive and inconvenient. That's why some people use a keygen to generate a product key for free.
  
A keygen is a software that creates random serial numbers that can be used to activate software products. However, using a keygen is illegal and risky. You may end up with a virus, malware, or spyware on your computer. You may also violate the software license agreement and face legal consequences.
  
Therefore, we do not recommend using a keygen to download and activate Xmanager 4. Instead, we suggest you to try the official trial version of Xmanager 4 from the developer's website[^1^]. You can use it for 30 days without any limitations. If you like it, you can buy a product key from the developer or an authorized reseller.
  
If you still want to use a keygen, you do so at your own risk. Here are the steps to download and activate Xmanager 4 with a keygen:
  
1. Download Xmanager 4 from the developer's website[^1^] or another source.
2. Install Xmanager 4 on your PC.
3. Download a keygen for Xmanager 4 from GitHub[^2^] or another source.
4. Run the keygen and click on "Generate".
5. Copy the product key from the keygen.
6. Open Xmanager 4 and go to "Help" > "Enter Product Key".
7. Paste the product key and click on "OK".
8. Enjoy using Xmanager 4.

We hope this article was helpful for you. However, we strongly advise you to avoid using a keygen and support the developers of Xmanager by purchasing a product key legally. Thank you for reading.
